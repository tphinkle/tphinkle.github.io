I am a data scientist and current fellow @ [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com). I graduated with a PhD in physics from the University of California, Irvine, in 2017 where my dissertation was on the development of novel microfluidic devices for rapid cell physical characterization.

You can find more information about the types of data science and coding projects I am interested in by exploring by reading my [coding project portfolio](http://tphinkle.github.io/portfolio/), looking over my [github repositories](https://github.com/tphinkle), or perusing [my blog](http://tphinkle.github.io/blog).

I am also in the market for data science positions in the Seattle area. Hire me!
