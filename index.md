I am a data scientist and current fellow @ Insight Data Science. I graduated with a PhD in physics from the University of California, Irvine, in 2017 where I focused on experimental biophysics research.

You can find more information about the types of data science and research I am interested in by exploring by reading my [coding project portfolio](http://tphinkle.github.io/portfolio/), looking over my [github repositories](https://github.com/tphinkle), or perusing [my blog](http://tphinkle.github.io/blog).

I am also in the market for data science positions in the Seattle area. Hire me!
You can find my [resume here](https://tphinkle.github.io/files/Preston_Hinkle_Resume.pdf).
