### Nanopore?
The most precise definition of nanopore: a hole with opening diameter on the order of 1 nm in size. I'll be the first to admit that this definition is a little dry, but there are a number of reasons, both academic and practical, that make nanopores worth studying. Nanopores exist naturally in nature, where they can be found in cells' membranes and act as channels that allow water, ions, and biomolecules to pass through. Many natural nanopores have interesting transport properties; for example, potassium ions diffuse freely through a potassium channel while sodium ions are blocked, despite the two ions being nearly identical in size and charge. This type of transport regulation is made possible by the pore's shape and its interior surface charge.

It is also possible to fabricate synthetic nanopores, which can be created using electron beam drilling, carbon nanotubes, and chemical etching, to name a few. One distinct advantage of synthetic pores is the ability to tailor their geometry to the application at hand; biological pores have a fixed size and shape. There are a number of different applications for both types of nanopores, including creating ionic circuits, water desalination, DNA sequencing, and biomolecule detection and characterization. Going back to the basic definition of nanopores 'a 1 nm in diameter hole', it is not immediately apparent why they are able to perform in all these applications. It turns out that the key is in something called the 'electrical double layer'. In the rest of this blog post we'll look into the properties of the nanopores, and in the [next post](https://tphinkle.github.io/blog/2016-11-1-nanopores_pt1) we'll explore why the EDL is responsible for nanopore's novel transport properties.

### The electrical double layer
In the bulk, a symmetric ion solution is composed of equal parts cation and anion and the total solution charge is neutral. As we approach a charged surface, the electric potential from the surface makes it more energetically favorable for ions of the opposite polarity--counterions--to populate the solution compared to coions. This region of net charge in the solution, approximately within ~1 nm of the surface, is known as the __electrical double layer__ or EDL. In reality, the composition of solution in the vicinity of a charged surface is highly complex. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to break the solution down into two regions, the EDL and the bulk. Here's a cartoon showing what the EDL looks like:

 Suppose we have a charged cylindrical nanopore of variable radius; the following plot shows the fractional volume of the EDL compared to the bulk, for a typical EDL length of 1 nm.

Notice that at around 100 nm the fraction of the ion solution within the EDL becomes appreciable and rapidly increases as the pore shrinks further into the nanoscale. For this reason, even though we typically define nanopores as holes around 1 nm in size, nanopore-like behavior can exist for pores having diameters of tens of nanometers.

#### Derivation

We can understand the formation of the electrical double layer as a competition between diffusion (chemical potential) and electrostatic forces (electric potential). 

Consider an infinite planar surface with constant surface charge $$\sigma$$, and a solution composed of water and two types of oppositely charged ions with the same valency $$z$$ dissolved in the solution with bulk concentratoin $$C_{0}$$. We seek to find the number density of each ion species $$C^{+}$$ and $$C^{-}$$ in the solution. The relevant equations here are [Poisson's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson's_equation) and the [Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution).

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Poisson equation}
\nabla^{2}\psi=-\rho/\epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}=-ze\left(C^{+}-C^{-}\right)/\epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Boltzmann distribution}
C^{\pm}=C_{0}e^{E^{\pm}/k_{B}T}=C_{0}e^{\mp ze\psi/k_{B}T}
\end{equation}
$$

In the above equations, $$\psi$$ is the electrostatic potential arising from the free ions and the surface charge, and $$\rho$$ is the net charge density at a given position. Note that because the boundary in our system is an infinite plane, we can reduce Poisson's equation to one-dimension, replacing the Laplace operator with a second derivative in one direction only, the $$x-$$direction. We combine the equations by inserting $$C^{\pm}$$ from the Boltzmann equation into the Poisson equation. Doing so, we arrive at the full __Poisson-Boltzmann__ equation:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Poisson-Boltzmann equation}
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^{2}}=\frac{2zeC_{0}}{\epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}}\text{sinh}\left(\frac{ze\psi}{k_{B}T}\right)
\end{equation}
$$

The two boundary conditions for the 2nd order differential equation are:

1. $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\rho\left(x\right)\text{dx}=\sigma$$ and
2. $$\frac{d\psi}{dx}\vert_{x\rightarrow\infty}=0$$,

which come from the requirements that the solution be neutral overall, and that there are no electric fields in the bulk, respectively. The non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation can be linearized and easily solved if $$ze\psi/k_{B}T\ll1$$, leading to the Debye-HÃ¼ckel equation, a good approximation in many cases. However, there is still an analytic solution in the general case. Solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation yields the following formula for the electrostatic potential $$\psi\left(x\right)$$, and hence, the  ion number densities $$C^{+}\left(x\right)$$ and $$C^{-}\left(x\right)$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Electric potential}
y=2\log\left(\frac{1-\gamma e^{-\kappa x}}{1+\gamma e^{-\kappa x}}\right)
\end{equation}
$$,

where $$\gamma=\frac{e^{y_{0}/2}-1}{e^{y_{0}/2}+1}$$, $$y=ze\psi/k_{B}T$$, and $$\kappa^{2}=\frac{2z^{2}e^{2}C_{0}}{\epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}k_{B}T}$$. The electrostatic potential at the surface, $$\psi_{0}$$, is related to the surface charge density via the __Grahame equation__:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Grahame equation}
\sigma=\epsilon_{0}\epsilon_{r}\psi_{0}\kappa^{-1}\left[\frac{2k_{B}T}{ze\psi}\sinh\left(\frac{z^{2}e\psi}{2k_{B}T}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
$$


In an experiment we don't know $$\sigma$$, and $$\psi_{0}$$ is usually what's measured instead. $$\kappa^{-1}$$ is known as the __Debye length__, an important parameter which is the measure of the size of the EDL. Notice that $$\kappa$$ does _not_ depend on the surface charge $$\sigma$$, but does depend on the bulk ion concentration $$C_{0}$$. This means that highly concentrated ion solutions screen over shorter lengths than diffuse solutions. Here's a plot of the Debye length $$\kappa^{-1}$$ for different bulk concentrations. Since $$100$$ mol/L is a common solution concentration, a rule-of-thumb is that the EDL is on order 1 nm thick, although it certainly deviates from that value at more extreme concentrations.

Plugging the solution for the electrostatic potential back into the Boltzmann equation yields the equations for $$C^{\pm}$$. With equations in-hand, we can begin to understand the structure of the EDL. Let's take a look at the most relevant features, the electrostatic potential $$\psi$$, the number densities of each species $$C^{\pm}$$, and the difference in number densities of the two species $$C^{+}-C^{-}$$, which is proportional to the charge density in the solution. We'll focus on exploring the relationship between these features and the surface charge density, $$\sigma$$. Note that solving for $$\psi$$, $$C^{+}$$, and $$C^{-}$$ requires knowing the surface potential $$\psi_{0}$$. This can be done via the Grahame-equation above, but must be solved numerically since it is a transcendental equation for $$\psi_{0}$$ given $$\sigma$$. I used the [scipy.optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/optimize.html) package to solve the equation. Here's a plot of the relationship between $$\sigma$$ and $$\phi$$ from the Grahame equation:

</div>

Interestingly, the relationship isn't perfectly linear as one might naively think. Without the ions (i.e. just a charged plate), the surface potential is directly proportional to the surface charge. 

The following two plots show the electrostatic potential and ion number densities as a function of distance from the charged surface. 

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="http://tphinkle.github.io/files/2017-1-3-nanopores_pt0/potential_0.png" alt="potential" style="width: 480px;" align="middle"/>
</div>

A couple things to point out. First, note that the surface potential $$\psi_{0}$ approximately linearly depends on the surface charge $$$\sigma$$, as predicted from the Grahame equation above. The sharp gradient in the electric potential within the EDL means there will be large electric fields, but these fields die off in the bulk as the potential becomes constant.

That's about it for the EDL! Although seemingly inoccuous, the EDL is responsible for the non-trivial parts of nanopore behavior.
