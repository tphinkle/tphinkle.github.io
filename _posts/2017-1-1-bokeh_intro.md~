[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is my go-to tool for plotting in Python; I like that it is essentially infinitely customizable, allowing you to create polished looking plots. But, if your goal is to create a dynamic, interactable visualization, matplotlib isn't the best, which is where [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) comes in. Bokeh allows you to create either static or dynamic interactive plots.

I fooled around in Bokeh a bit and created a couple visualizations to show off how easy it is to get up and running. Since I don't host my own website, I don't have a way of creating dynamic plots with server-end processing. Keep in mind that i fyou're using hte full Bokeh-JS server you can add much more interactivity to your plots.

Here are a couple simple examples, which you can find [the code](#code) for at the end of the post:
