What is regression? Regression is when, given some data consisting of some independent variables and dependent variables, we'd like come up with some model that best explains their relationship. The first time you saw regression was probably in high school, when you were given some simple x-y data and asked to plot a best-fit line through the data points. What you were actually performing was a *simple linear regression*, which is the term for a linear regression model with only one independent variable.
