I've written a few different pieces of software over the past two years for research and various other miscellaneous purposes. Here's a quick summary of some of the larger projects that I've completed.

# nanoIV

This is a GUI program written in C++ and Qt that enables remote control of a Keithley picoammeter. Two specific measurement protocols, IV curve and time-series measurement, are set-up and available simultaneously. The program displays the data in real-time and can be used to save the data. A separate script written in Python can be used to create a formatted Excel document from the acquired data. This was written to make my lab's IV curve measurements more efficient and to provide real-time feedback on the noise characteristics of the systems we measure.

# pore stats

This was a program I wrote as part of a fellowship for creating an open-source data analysis package for [resistive pulse experiments](tphinkle.github.io/research/#resistive_pulse_sensing). 

# cell controller

# spectranalyzer

This was a quick program I wote in Python and PyQt to teach my niece about sound waves and frequency. The app takes in sound from a connected microphone and displays the waveform or the power spectrum (PSD) to the screen.
