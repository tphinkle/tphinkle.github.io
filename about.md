I am a graduate student working in an experimental biophysics lab at the University of California, Irvine. 

Outside of physics, my academic interests are in data science and programming.

You can find out more about my work on my [Research](https://tphinkle.github.io/research/) and [Blog](https://tphinkle.github.io/) pages.
