### Introduction

I currently work with [Professor Zuzanna Siwy](http://www.physics.uci.edu/~zsiwy/) doing experiments on [nanopores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanopore) and microfluidics at the University of California Irvine.

As the name suggests, nanopores are small holes around one billionth of a meter in diameter. Nanopores exist naturally in biology, where they can be found in cell and nuclear membranes.

In the Siwy lab we work primarily with synthetic nano- and micropores. Nanopores are used in a surprisingly large variety of applications, including water desalination, biomolecule sensing, enhanced drug delivery, and ionic circuitry. 

The following are some of the projects I've worked on.

## Resistive pulse sensing

When a nanopore is filled with a conducting solution such as KCl, a voltage applied across the pore will induce an ionic current across the pore. The nanopore is analagous to a resistor in a traditional electronic circuit. When a particle enters the pore it changes the pores resistance, which can be measured as a decrease in the measured ionic current. This simple process is the basis for resistive pulse sensing, whereby the properties of particles can be inferred from their resistive pulse signature.

Resistive pulse sensing has been used to measure particle concentration, size, and charge.

## Transport in single walled carbon nanotubes

A carbon nanotube is a one-atom thick tube of carbon atoms arranged in a hexoganol lattice. By embedding a single carbon nanotube in an insulating layer we can use the carbon nanotube as a nanopore. These carbon nanotubes can be as small as 1 nm in diameter! Although they are conceptually one of the simplest nanopores, researchers claim they exhibit some exotic transport properties like ionic currents and water velocities orders of magnitude larger than expected, ion species selectivity, and sensitivity to single ions.

Along with my collaborators, I am helping to test a new carbon nanotube. In particular, we are interested in testing the ion and water transport properties of the carbon nanotubes to see if we can help move the field to a consensus. 

## Induced-charge current rectification

The largest breakthrough in electronics was the invention of the transistor, which allowed for a novel control of the current in a circuit and is the base element of every computer today.
